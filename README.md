# Apollo full-stack GraphQL tech challenge

This is the documentation for the Apollo full-stack GraphQL tech challenge.

## Build and deployment instructions

Here are the instructions to follow if you want to deploy a stack for the Apollo full-stack GraphQL tech challenge in AWS.
You are likely to find the process cumbersome, I don't think we will be friends after you went through that little ordeal.
Anyway, here we go.

### Preparation: get your launchpad ready

1. Clone [this repo](https://github.com/TME520/fullstack-tutorial.git),
2. Setup your own [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/),
3. Create a Jenkins pipeline named `deployApollo`,
4. In the Jenkins home directory (usually /var/lib/jenkins), locate its `config.xml` file (should be `/var/lib/jenkins/jobs/deployApollo/config.xml`) and [update it with this content](https://github.com/TME520/jenkinslab/blob/master/declarative/prepareP7ParamsFile.config.xml)
